# RaspberryPiS2
Use Scratch 2 on a PC to control GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi using ScratchGPIO

This is alpha code - use at own risk

Before using this - please make sure that you are familiar with running ScratchGPIO on a Raspberry Pi

Then, make sure you can use SID to let Scratch 1.4 on a PC control the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi on the same network

Then you can do the following

Reboot Pi

Run Handshake.exe on PC and connect to Pi (please check the plus box)

Then run Scratch2GPIO.py (as a Python 2 prog)

Then run Scratch 2 and right-click File and select Import Experimental Extension

You should see extra blocks available

The generic "scratch gpio" block is equivalent to using broadcast in Scratch 1.4

other specific blocks will be added to in the future
